    <li>Your billing address must match the address where you receive the credit card statement.</li>
    <li>All orders require the billing address be completed, even if your order total is $0.  If your order total is $0 you may select the Cleary Building Corporate Office as your billing address.</li>
    <li>If you are using a gift card, be sure to select gift card as the payment method.  If your order total exceeds the available amount on the gift card, you will be prompted to provide a credit card to cover the balance.
