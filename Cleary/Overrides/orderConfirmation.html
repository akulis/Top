If you are redeeming a gift card, you should see the gift card as a payment type. If your order exceeds the gift card amount, you should see both the gift cart and credit card as payment methods. If the coupon amount has not been deducted or the gift card has not been applied, DO NOT CLICK SUBMIT! Click the “View Cart” button to go back and apply these options.</p>
