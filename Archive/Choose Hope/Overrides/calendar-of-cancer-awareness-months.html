      <h3>Ribbons</h3>
      <p>Who determines ribbon colors? Choose Hope does not make up the cancer awareness colors, and contrary to popular belief, neither does the American Cancer Society.</p>
      <p>Ribbon colors are determined by nationally recognized, non-profit organizations that provide support, education, and awareness for individual cancers.</p>
