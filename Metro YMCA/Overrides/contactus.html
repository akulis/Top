<strong>Shipping Rates and Policies</strong><br />
All online orders are shipped via UPS Ground shipping or US Postal Service. Your rates are calculated based on the weight of your shipment and the current freight rates from these carriers. If you select an expedited ship method, please be aware that
this does not expedite the order processing time frames below, if you need an order processed as a rush, please contact customer service and we will try to accommodate your request. <br />
<br />
Orders containing stock only will ship within 3 working days. Orders containing custom/non-inventory items ship within 10 working days (please note the day the order is submitted does not count).
<br />
<br />
If an order contains both stock and custom/non-inventory product, the entire order will be shipped within 10 working days. If you need the stock items shipped early, you must place as two separate orders, one for stock and one for non-inventory. If a
stock item is currently out of stock (back ordered), the back ordered item will ship as soon as it becomes available (usually within 10-12 business days).
Item descriptions will indicate if an item is stock or non-inventory.
