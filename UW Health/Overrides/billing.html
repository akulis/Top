            Please provide the address where the invoice should be sent. If you have authority to place orders using a purchase order but do not have that option on the billing screen, please contact Customer Service at 608-826-6990 or e-mail <a href="mailto:webservices@toppromotions.com?subject=UW%20Health%20Purchase%20Order%20Question">webservices@toppromotions.com</a>. Once we verify you have purchase order authority, purchase order will become an available option as payment method. Items in your cart will remain in your cart while we confirm authorization.
